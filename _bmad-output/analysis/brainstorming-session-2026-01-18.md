# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Vic
**Date:** 2026-01-18

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Social music curation system - turning WhatsApp group song shares into personalized, mood-based playlists

**Goals:**
- Combat streaming algorithm fatigue through trusted friend curation
- Analyze songs shared in WhatsApp group (genres, styles, patterns)
- Track social signals (who shared, who liked/reacted)
- Generate mood-based ~2 hour music sets
- Balance discovery (songs you don't know) with comfort (already liked songs)

### Key Constraints
- WhatsApp as primary input source
- Spotify as music platform
- Must handle diverse music styles
- Personal preference query ("what do I want right now?")

### Unique Value Proposition
Human curation filter (friends only share "great" songs they believe others will enjoy) + social context awareness

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Social music curation system with focus on combating algo fatigue through friend curation

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Role Playing** - Understand stakeholder perspectives (user, friends who share, group dynamics)
2. **Cross-Pollination** - Draw inspiration from adjacent domains (recommendation systems, mixtape culture, social networks)
3. **First Principles Thinking** - Strip away assumptions and rebuild core concept from fundamentals

**AI Rationale:** This sequence covers empathy/user-centered design → creative expansion from other domains → foundational clarity for differentiation

## Technique Execution Results

### Technique 1: Role Playing

**Perspectives Explored:** User wanting music, Friend who shares songs, Group dynamics

**Key Insights Generated:**

1. **The Shuffle Paradox** — Even 2000 songs you love become useless when shuffle ignores mood. The problem isn't song quality — it's context blindness.

2. **Contextual Sensing Over Explicit Input** — The ideal interaction is no interaction. System reads time, day, weather and infers mood without asking.

3. **Good Surprise = New + Perfect Fit** — Discovery that feels inevitable in hindsight — "how did I not know this song?"

4. **Three-Tier Feedback System** — Skip ≠ Dislike. Create distinct signals: Skip = "love it, wrong moment", Not This = "never again", Engagement = positive reinforcement.

5. **Passive Learning + Active Override** — Default is invisible learning from behavior, but mood override available because humans are unpredictable.

6. **Discovery-Heavy Ratio** — Lean into new songs from friend-curated pool. Familiar songs are anchors, not the main course.

7. **The Accessibility Filter** — Sharers self-curate for group compatibility. Only tracks with crossover potential make the cut.

8. **Gateway Tracks** — Niche genres enter the group through their most accessible representatives.

9. **Multi-Signal Engagement** — Reactions come in layers: explicit (emoji), silent (playlist add), delayed (remove after re-listen).

10. **Taste Affinity Weighting** — Some users may value certain sharers more. Personalized trust scores per sharer as power-user feature.

11. **Scalable Data Pool** — ~5 songs/week × years = substantial library. System must handle both small and large group scales.

12. **Multi-Platform Reality** — Songs arrive as Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud links. System needs to normalize across platforms.

13. **Organic Context Tags** — "Perfect for a rainy day" is free metadata. When provided, it's gold.

### Technique 2: Cross-Pollination

**Domains Explored:** Mixtape culture, Radio DJs, TikTok's algorithm, Restaurant tasting menus, Live DJ sets, Spotify Wrapped, Meditation apps

**Key Insights Generated:**

14. **Narrative Arc Playlists** — Playlists should tell a story — build up, peak, cool down. Not random shuffle but intentional energy sequencing.

15. **Music as Guided Journey** — Core thesis: music should be a curated journey, not a shuffle lottery. "We lack magic because we shuffle thousands of songs."

16. **Gentle Intensity Surprise** — A rainy evening might seem like you want mellow, but a well-timed intensity peak makes the journey memorable.

17. **Personalized DJ Personas** — Personas built from YOUR mood patterns and liked music. "Your rainy day DJ" is different from mine.

18. **Invisible Friend Attribution** — "Marco shared this" appears subtly while listening — warmth without interruption.

19. **Success Metric = "I Feel Great"** — The journey's finality is an emotional state. Measure transformation, not engagement.

20. **Learn from TikTok, Don't Become TikTok** — Steal fast behavioral learning. Reject infinite scroll and addiction loops.

21. **Finite by Design** — The journey has an end. Anti-TikTok: satisfying completion vs. endless consumption.

22. **The Live DJ Set Standard** — The gold standard is a great DJ's live set: hours of deliberate curation, energy management, breathless finale.

23. **"Wanting More" + "Feeling Complete"** — The paradox of a perfect ending: satisfied AND wanting more.

24. **Energy Management as Core Feature** — Understand when to push, when to let breathe, how to build anticipation. Journey architecture, not just song matching.

25. **Social Features as Seasoning** — Vibe overlap stats are fun conversation starters, but secondary to core magic.

26. **Purpose Framing Without Burden** — "Here's what I've prepared for you" vs. "What do you want?" The chef announces the menu.

27. **Intro Moment as Hypothesis** — Brief 2-3 second intro before first song. Test whether it enhances "surrender" or creates friction.

28. **Surrender as Core UX** — Dominant user mode: "I don't want to think, take me somewhere." Control available but not required.

---

### Technique 3: First Principles Thinking

**Focus:** Strip away assumptions, find bedrock truths, identify what's essential

**Key Insights Generated:**

29. **Four-Pillar Problem** — Not one problem but four: Discovery, Curation, Context, Experience. Solving one without others is incomplete.

30. **Friends Filter, Algorithms Discover** — Friends don't discover better than algorithms — they FILTER better. You're algo + human taste layer.

31. **Flexible Journey Length** — 2 hours isn't sacred. Journey architecture scales to 30-min commute or 4-hour work session.

32. **Input Source Agnostic** — WhatsApp is prototype, not limit. Discord, forums, subreddits all work. Principle: trusted human curation.

33. **Work Listening as Primary Use Case** — "Open website, connect Spotify, quick mood, let magic happen." Daily companion, not weekend app.

34. **MVP Core = Four Essentials** — Spotify connection + WhatsApp scan + mood picker + journey architecture. Nothing else required for magic.

35. **Journey Architecture is Non-Negotiable** — Can strip away everything else. Without journey architecture, you're just another shuffler.

36. **Two Existential Risks** — (1) Can songs be meaningfully profiled? (2) Can AI craft intentional journeys? Both solvable.

37. **Validation Ladder** — Demanding friends → DJ friends who craft sets professionally. Real taste arbiters, not metrics.

38. **DJ Sets as Training Data** — World's best DJs already solved journey architecture. Learn patterns, apply to personalized pools.

39. **Acquisition as Strategy** — Don't fight Spotify. Build what they can't (community + journey AI), become acquisition target.

40. **Two Acquirable Assets** — What Spotify would pay for: (1) Pre-validated tastemaker community, (2) Proven journey architecture AI.
